# Getting Started

OpenDTU supports the ESP32 family of microcontrollers.

Depending on the inverter to be addressed, different RF modules are required. The HM series requires the NRF24L01+ module, while the HMS/HMT series requires the CMT2300A module.
Please see the [inverter overview](../hardware/inverter_overview.md) to see if your inverter is supported and to determine the required RF module.
