# OpenDTU Breakoutboard

We sat down together and designed a PCB. This is 100% compatible with openDTU and has space for all extensions such as display and LEDs. You can find the PCB design here: <https://github.com/marove2000/openDTU_BreakoutBoard>

A ready to solder kit can be found here: <https://shop.blinkyparts.com/en/OpenDTU-Your-evaluation-for-your-balcony-solar-system/blink237542>
